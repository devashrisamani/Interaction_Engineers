          The Zen Den reimagines the traditional Japanese Zen garden through the
          integration of modern technology, creating an interactive and
          immersive art piece designed to foster relaxation and creativity. By
          incorporating sensor-enabled rakes and interactive sand surfaces, Zen
          Den allows users to engage dynamically with the environment. These
          rakes, responsive to user gestures like tapping and raking, activate
          auditory and visual feedback through LED displays and sound outputs,
          enhancing the sensory experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project embodies the theme of "interactive, playful
          visualizations," aiming to transform the way we engage with
          traditional cultural practices through modern technological
          enhancements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zen Den is designed for environments where calm and creativity are
          cherished—ranging from wellness centers and art therapy rooms to
          meditation studios and private homes. By integrating traditional
          mindfulness practices technology, Zen Den offers a peaceful retreat
          from the hustle and bustle of daily life, inviting users to explore
          their artistic side while experiencing deep relaxation and mental
          clarity.

        <!-- Technical Description – a description of how the project is built (physical form, technology hardware and software). -->
        <section class="technical-description">
          <h2>Technical Description</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, our setup included an ultrasonic sensor for proximity
            detection, a buzzer for audio outputs, and an LED light for visual
            feedback. These components were connected to an Arduino
            microprocessor, which managed operations based on user interactions.
            Throughout the development phase, we conducted multiple rounds of
            User Acceptance Testing (UAT) internally to identify and rectify as
            many usability and technical issues as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the project progressed, we received extensive feedback that
            emphasized the need to enhance the sound quality of our prototype
            and create a more dynamic user experience. In response, we made
            several iterations to refine the design and better align with our
            goal of delivering a playful, interactive experience. We integrated
            the Arduino with Unity, a powerful game development platform, to
            advance the quality of the sound outputs. Additionally, we added
            multiple LED strips to the Zen Den gardening tools, which
            synchronized the lighting patterns with user movements and
            interactions. To further enrich the experience, we employed Unity to
            visualize user movements on the sand with aesthetically pleasing and
            impressive graphics. In our final enhancement, we focused on
            customization, developing a hand gesture recognition system within
            the rake. This system allows users to modify the audio and visual
            settings by performing simple gestures, such as tapping, enabling
            them to personalize their meditation sessions according to their
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, Zen Den brings to life the concept of interactive and
            playful visualizations by integrating sensor-enabled rakes and a
            dynamic sand surface that responds to human touch and movement. As
            participants interact with the Zen Den, their gestures—such as
            raking and tapping—activate a series of visual and auditory feedback
            mechanisms. This includes patterns of light that mimic the ripples
            in traditional Zen gardens and soothing sounds that enhance the
            meditative experience. The playful yet thoughtful integration of
            these elements invites users to explore the boundaries of creativity
            and interaction, turning a simple garden into a canvas for personal
            expression and exploration.
